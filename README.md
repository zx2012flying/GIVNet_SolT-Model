# GIVNet_SolT-Model
This repository saved the exact GIVNet_SolT model for organic-in-organic solubility prediction
'Model comparison' contains the models (e.g., KNN, NN, lightGBM) compared  
'Cross-validation' contains the data and model for 10-fold cross-validation
‘Final model for prediction’ contains the final GIVNet-SolT model for interpolation and extrapolation
